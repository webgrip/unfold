# Architecture Decision Records

This directory is **the** decision ledger for Ploeg ([0001](0001-adrs-are-the-decision-ledger.md)).
If a decision outlives the change that prompted it, it is a record here — not a
row in `design.md`, not a paragraph in a research dossier, not an assistant's
memory.

Format is [MADR 4.0.0](https://adr.github.io/madr/) with two local extensions.

## The two local rules

**1. Supersession is append-only.** An accepted record's own `status:` is never
flipped. The superseding record carries `supersedes: NNNN`; the Records table
below shows `superseded by NNNN` for readers. The file is the historical
artefact; this index is the current view. Files are never renamed and numbers
are never reused.

**2. A decision that can change carries a dated review.** `review-by:
YYYY-MM-DD` in the front matter plus a `## Re-evaluation triggers` section
naming the observable events that reopen it. Prefer facts someone could check in
five minutes ("spec reaches 1.0", "issue #1029 closes") over judgements someone
has to form. `review-by: none` is a legitimate answer for a decision that only
changes if the project changes shape.

Both rules are enforced, not merely requested — see *Validation* below.

## Writing one

Copy [adr-template.md](adr-template.md) to `NNNN-kebab-title.md` with the next
number. The title names the *decision*, not the topic: "Go is the implementation
language", not "Language choice".

Every record needs a `### Confirmation` subsection naming how compliance is
actually checked — a CI gate with its command, a review step, or a script.
"Reviewers will notice" is not a confirmation, and the validator rejects a
record that omits the section.

The evidence stays out. A survey's working belongs in
`docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`, linked from *More Information*. The ADR
carries the verdict, the reasoning, and the triggers.

The [`adr-writer`](https://forgejo.webgrip.dev/webgrip/webgrip-ai-skills) skill
knows this format. Its **bundled validator does not apply here** — it assumes
vanilla status-flip supersession and would reject this corpus. Use the local
script.

## Validation

```sh
go test ./internal/ledger/
```

It runs inside the existing `go test ./...` step of
`.forgejo/workflows/on_pull_request.yml` — no extra CI step, no `python3`
dependency in the runner. It gates filename and number discipline, status
legality, `supersedes:` integrity, file↔index parity in both directions, the
status and date mirrors, the presence of `### Confirmation`, and that a dated
`review-by` is backed by a `## Re-evaluation triggers` section.

Adding a record means adding its row below in the same commit; the parity check
fails otherwise.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `proposed` | Written, not ratified. Do not design against it yet. |
| `accepted` | In force. Design within it or supersede it. |
| `rejected` | Considered and declined. Kept so the reasoning is not re-derived. |
| `deprecated` | No longer relevant, and nothing replaced it. |
| `superseded by NNNN` | **Index-only.** The file's own status stays as it was. |
