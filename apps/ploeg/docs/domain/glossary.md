# Glossary — Ploeg

*Generated from `model.yaml` — do not edit by hand.*

The [combined Glide glossary](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md) lists every term of every model once, with its owner and the words it must not be confused with.

## Admission
*Context: Dispatch*

Ploeg's decision to accept work for execution and record it. Operator work is admitted when an authenticated Operator Consumer asks, for example on Vloer Start; tracker work enters through an Assignment and the Routing Rules. No Run starts before its work is admitted.

**See also:** [Authority](#authority), [Operator Execution](#operator-execution), [Operator Consumer](#operator-consumer), [Assignment](#assignment), [Work Item](#work-item)  

## Agent Container
*Context: Harness*

The container a Run executes: a Harness plus its Adapter, invoked with a Task Spec and obligated to write an Outcome Report before exit. Credentials arrive through scoped runtime configuration, never in the spec.

**See also:** [Run](#run), [Task Spec](#task-spec), [Outcome Report](#outcome-report)  

## Assignment
*Context: Dispatch*

The normalized tracker event that offers an ingested Work Item to agents, transitioning it to queued. Assigning in the tracker is the sole human gesture that puts work in front of agents; which Team and which Work Target it resolves to is decided by the Routing Rules, never carried in the event.

**See also:** [Tracker Event](#tracker-event), [Routing Rule](#routing-rule), [Team Queue](#team-queue)  

## Authority
*Context: Dispatch*

The one party entitled to approve a Run, set its budget and grant or revoke its credentials. Ploeg is the Authority for every Run (Glide ADR-0002). A Run never switches to another authority because a connection fails.

**See also:** [Admission](#admission), [Inference Account](#inference-account), [Push Credential](#push-credential), [Run](#run)  

## Checkpoint
*Context: Dispatch*

The small durable progress record (phase, branch, PR URL) a Run writes via the report API. The Task Spec can carry one, but the current unattended worker does not inject the last stored Checkpoint automatically. Retained repository changes and evidence support recovery; native harness state is not a portable Checkpoint.

**See also:** [Run](#run), [Task Spec](#task-spec)  

## Delivery Candidate
*Context: Dispatch*

An immutable proposed repository tree with a canonical commit on an approved base, artifact digests and a verification policy digest, bound to one Operator Execution generation. Worker assertions do not verify it.

**See also:** [Operator Execution](#operator-execution), [Verification Receipt](#verification-receipt), [Publication Operation](#publication-operation)  

## Executor
*Context: Execution*

The component that performs admitted Runs and reports progress and outcomes. Current unattended execution uses Kubernetes workers; Vloer performs delegated operator execution until Glide ADR-0002 moves it to ploeg-worker. The controller recovers missing reports through expiry and reconciliation, without a Kubernetes Job watcher.

**See also:** [Run](#run)  

## Follow-Up
*Context: Dispatch*

A Work Item created by other work rather than by a person: from a Forge Event (review submitted, check failed, merge-state dirty), or from a Run that splits work or records work it discovered (Product R12). It references its source PR and Work Item, carries that Work Item's Work Target, is routed to the Team owning the source branch, and enters the lifecycle directly at queued. Today only a failed check creates one, and only for a Team that enabled forgeFollowUps.repairFailedChecks: one open repair per pull request, capped per pull request. No Run creates one yet.

**See also:** [Work Item](#work-item), [Forge Event](#forge-event), [Team](#team), [Work Target](#work-target)  

## Forge
*Context: Integration*

One registered git forge instance: id, endpoint, dialect, git identity, credential source. A Work Target names a Forge by id and the registry resolves the rest, so no Work Item ever carries a URL or a token. Distinct from a Forge Provider, which is the adapter speaking one Forge's dialect.

**Examples:** the in-cluster Forgejo instance; a second Forgejo; github.com  
**See also:** [Forge Provider](#forge-provider), [Work Target](#work-target)  

## Forge Event
*Context: Integration*

The normalized result of parsing a forge webhook — review_submitted, check_failed, or merge_state_dirty — with the Work Target, PR, branch, and the feedback body for classification. Source of every Follow-Up; carrying a Work Target is what lets the follow-up path and the assignment path converge on one type.

**See also:** [Follow-Up](#follow-up), [Forge Provider](#forge-provider), [Work Target](#work-target)  

## Forge Provider
*Context: Integration*

The SPI adapter for one git forge: verify and parse webhooks into normalized Forge Events and write back PR comments. Reference implementation: Forgejo. The adapter, not the instance it speaks to — that is a Forge.

**See also:** [Tracker Provider](#tracker-provider), [Forge Event](#forge-event), [Forge](#forge)  

## Harness
*Context: Harness*

A concrete agent tool (Claude Code, opencode, …): the program that manages an agent's conversation with a model and runs the tools it is permitted to use. Ploeg never talks to a Harness directly — only through a Harness Adapter — because this boundary churns fastest of any in the system.

**See also:** [Harness Adapter](#harness-adapter), [Agent Container](#agent-container), [Model](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#model)  

## Harness Adapter
*Context: Harness*

The thin wrapper that makes one Harness satisfy the harness contract: accept a Task Spec, drive the tool, emit an Outcome Report. Adapters are the isolation layer for harness churn; ACP is tracked as a candidate standard to adopt instead of inventing more.

**See also:** [Harness](#harness), [Task Spec](#task-spec), [Outcome Report](#outcome-report)  

## Inference Account
*Context: Execution*

The durable authorization and accounting record for a Run's scoped inference capability. Uncertain issuance, blocking, expiry and observed spend retain unresolved authorization until trusted final evidence reconciles it. An observed debit is not settlement.

**See also:** [Run](#run), [Operator Execution](#operator-execution)  

## Lease
*Context: Dispatch*

The exclusive right to WRITE a Shift's branch, unique per Shift. It is a capability rather than a note: the holder's push credential is minted with it and revoked when it lapses, so holding a Lease and being able to push are one fact. Only a writing Run takes one — reading Runs take none, which is what lets any number of them run at once. A Lease governs exclusion only; liveness belongs to the Run, because a Run is what dies and a reader has no Lease to expire.

**Do not use:** claim (as a noun), lock  
**See also:** [Shift](#shift), [Run](#run), [Push Credential](#push-credential)  

## Operator Consumer
*Context: Integration*

A named service identity with explicit Team scope and separate read and execution permissions. It authenticates the human actor and authorizes registered repositories before requesting an Operator Execution.

**See also:** [Team](#team), [Operator Execution](#operator-execution)  

## Operator Execution
*Context: Dispatch*

A Ploeg record admitted for an authenticated Operator Consumer and linked to its session. Vloer Start requests admission even when the person will steer the work live. It links one Work Item, Shift and Run and retains its identity through changes in supervision.

**Not to be confused with** [Shift](#shift): The whole attempt on a Work Item. An Operator Execution is the admitted record that links one.  
**See also:** [Work Item](#work-item), [Shift](#shift), [Run](#run), [Operator Consumer](#operator-consumer), [Inference Account](#inference-account)  

## Outcome
*Context: Dispatch*

The terminal result of a Run, one of: pr_opened, pr_updated, issue_updated, follow_up_created, stuck, failed, no_change_needed. A stuck Outcome carries a mandatory reason and moves the Work Item to needs_human on the tracker path. A failed Outcome follows the applicable tracker or operator recovery policy; it does not universally authorize retry.

**Not to be confused with** [Result](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#result): The deliverable and evidence that a person reviews against the Acceptance Conditions.  
**Not to be confused with** [Verdict](#verdict): A reading Run's opinion of the work; an Outcome classifies how the Run itself ended.  
**See also:** [Outcome Report](#outcome-report), [Run](#run)  

## Outcome Report
*Context: Harness*

The output contract of an Agent Container: Outcome, summary, links, and optionally a new Checkpoint, written before exit. An absent report is not a successful outcome; expiry and reconciliation record the recovery state.

**See also:** [Task Spec](#task-spec), [Outcome](#outcome), [Verdict](#verdict)  

## Publication Operation
*Context: Integration*

A durable, explicitly approved operation to publish one verified Delivery Candidate. An in-flight or uncertain external effect retains a barrier against a replacement execution or duplicate publication.

**See also:** [Delivery Candidate](#delivery-candidate), [Verification Receipt](#verification-receipt), [Operator Execution](#operator-execution)  

## Push Credential
*Context: Execution*

The repository-scoped forge token minted for one writing Run and revoked when its Lease settles or lapses. What makes the Lease enforceable rather than advisory, and the reason a reading Run cannot write the branch it is reviewing. The model-provider equivalent is the per-Run LiteLLM key.

**Do not use:** builder token, deploy key  
**See also:** [Lease](#lease), [Run](#run)  

## Role
*Context: Dispatch*

A named specialist function within a Team (implementer, reviewer, tester), bound to a harness image and model. A Role is a slot in the manifest; a Run is one execution of that slot. Every Role is either a writer (mutates the tree, so its Runs take the Shift's Lease) or a reader (reads and opines, so its Runs take no Lease and may run beside others).

**Also known as:** specialist, specialist role  
**See also:** [Team](#team), [Run](#run), [Lease](#lease)  

## Round
*Context: Dispatch*

A set of Runs within a Shift that start together. Runs in one Round never observe each other — they receive the same injected state and their findings land afterwards; every later Round sees everything from every earlier one. A Round is either a fan-out of reading Runs or exactly one writing Run, never both, and that rule is the whole of the concurrency control.

**Do not use:** turn, iteration  
**See also:** [Shift](#shift), [Run](#run)  

## Routing Rule
*Context: Dispatch*

The operator-declared mapping from (provider, Scope, actor, hint) to a Team and a Work Target. Rules are ordered and first-match-wins, evaluated once at ingest; an event that matches no rule is never dispatched. The set of Work Targets reachable through the rules is closed and operator-declared, so a hint selects among registered routes and can never construct one (R11).

**Do not use:** team map  
**See also:** [Scope](#scope), [Work Target](#work-target), [Team](#team), [Tracker Event](#tracker-event)  

## Run
*Context: Execution*

One execution of one Role against a Work Item, realized by an Executor as a Kubernetes Job or a delegated workbench execution. A Lease may accumulate several Runs (roles, retries, resumes). The runner reports its outcome; controller expiry and reconciliation recover missing reports while preserving operator stop intent. "Job" is reserved for the Kubernetes object and is never a domain term. A delegated Run may contain several Vloer Steps until Vloer's engine is retired (Glide ADR-0002).

**Do not use:** job (as a domain term), role run  
**Not to be confused with** [Shift](#shift): The whole attempt on a Work Item, which contains one or more Runs.  
**Not to be confused with** [Step](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#step): A Vloer-internal part of one Run; older Vloer text says "role run".  
**See also:** [Role](#role), [Outcome](#outcome), [Outcome Report](#outcome-report), [Executor](#executor), [Lease](#lease)  

## Scope
*Context: Integration*

An opaque, provider-scoped container id for a body of work (a Vikunja project, a Jira project, a GitHub repository), carried on every Tracker Event. Ploeg compares a Scope for equality against Routing Rule keys and never parses, splits, or otherwise interprets it — equality-only is the test that keeps a vendor concept out of the core (R7).

**Also known as:** container id  
**See also:** [Tracker Event](#tracker-event), [Routing Rule](#routing-rule), [Tracker Provider](#tracker-provider)  

## Shift
*Context: Dispatch*

One Team's engagement with one Work Item: the container that owns the branch, the budget pool, the roster of Runs and the Round counter. Opens when the first Run starts, closes when the work reaches a terminal state. A Shift is what makes several Runs on one item coherent without any of them needing to remember the others. Named for the crew sense — Ploeg is Dutch for a crew, and ploegendienst is shift work.

**Do not use:** claim (as a noun), engagement, session, execution  
**Not to be confused with** [Execution](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#execution): A retired product term for the same attempt. The word still names a bounded context and is part of Operator Execution.  
**Not to be confused with** [Session](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#session): Vloer's record of a person's interaction; a started session links to one Shift.  
**See also:** [Lease](#lease), [Run](#run), [Round](#round), [Team](#team), [Work Item](#work-item)  

## Task Spec
*Context: Harness*

The input contract of an Agent Container: Work Item snapshot, Role, optional Checkpoint, and the Work Item's Work Target together with the forge endpoint its Forge id resolves to. Injected as a file mount or environment; deliberately credential-free (R8).

**See also:** [Outcome Report](#outcome-report), [Agent Container](#agent-container), [Work Target](#work-target), [Forge](#forge)  

## Team
*Context: Dispatch*

A declarative manifest — name, Roles, harness image and model per Role, run strategy (sequential or parallel), resource/token budget, concurrency cap — that is the unit of claiming. Two Teams never hold a Shift on the same Work Item; any number of Roles work within one Team's Shift. A Team never names a repository, forge, or credential: capacity and codebase are independent axes (R11) — those coordinates are the Work Item's Work Target, not the Team's.

**Do not use:** crew  
**Not to be confused with** [Crew](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#crew): Vloer's registered list of Roles for a session; it maps to a Team.  
**Examples:** implementer + reviewer-on-a-different-model-family + tester  
**See also:** [Role](#role), [Shift](#shift), [Work Target](#work-target)  

## Team Queue
*Context: Dispatch*

The ordered set of queued Work Items for one Team — a derived view, not a stored entity. Order mirrors the tracker's priority/rank, falling back to oldest-first; Ploeg never owns prioritization, the board does.

**Also known as:** pick-up queue  
**See also:** [Assignment](#assignment), [Work Item](#work-item)  

## Tracker Event
*Context: Integration*

The normalized result of parsing a tracker webhook — assigned, updated, or unassigned — carrying the external id, the provider's Scope, the actor, and normalized hints. It never carries a Ploeg Team or a repository: choosing either is core policy, decided by the Routing Rules (R7). The core only ever sees normalized events, never raw vendor payloads.

**See also:** [Assignment](#assignment), [Tracker Provider](#tracker-provider), [Scope](#scope), [Routing Rule](#routing-rule)  

## Tracker Item
*Context: Integration*

The authoritative item in the external tracker (Vikunja, Jira, GitHub Issues, …). Ploeg reads it via a Tracker Provider and mirrors it into a Work Item; all content edits happen in the tracker, never in Ploeg.

**Also known as:** issue  
**See also:** [Work Item](#work-item), [Tracker Provider](#tracker-provider)  

## Tracker Provider
*Context: Integration*

The SPI adapter for one task-management system: verify and parse webhooks into normalized Tracker Events, fetch items for mirroring, and write back comments and status. Reference implementation: Vikunja.

**See also:** [Forge Provider](#forge-provider), [Tracker Event](#tracker-event)  

## Verdict
*Context: Harness*

A reading Run's answer to "is this done?", reported in its Outcome Report: approve or request_changes, or empty for no opinion. A request_changes Verdict can open a capped fix Round (Ploeg ADR-0017). Vloer's reviewer prompt also accepts inconclusive.

**Not to be confused with** [Review](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#review): A judgement of a Result against its Acceptance Conditions. A Verdict is Evidence for it, not acceptance.  
**See also:** [Outcome Report](#outcome-report), [Round](#round), [Role](#role)  

## Verification Receipt
*Context: Execution*

Evidence reported by an explicitly authorized verifier for one Delivery Candidate and policy digest. It records the real check exit and discovery count from an independent disposable environment.

**See also:** [Delivery Candidate](#delivery-candidate), [Operator Consumer](#operator-consumer)  

## Work Item
*Context: Dispatch*

A unit of work: something we have decided to do, or a problem described well enough that a solution can be formulated or at least conceived. It comes from a Tracker Item, from an Operator Execution admitted through Vloer, or from other work (a Follow-Up). Ploeg keeps one record per Work Item and runs Shifts against it; a failed Shift leaves it in place. Tracker-originated content remains owned by the Tracker Item. Manual-origin content is registered by an authenticated Operator Consumer and never silently creates a Tracker Item.

**Do not use:** task, ticket  
**See also:** [Tracker Item](#tracker-item), [Lease](#lease), [Follow-Up](#follow-up), [Work Target](#work-target)  

## Work Target
*Context: Dispatch*

The forge coordinates a Work Item's Runs act on: forge, owner, repository, base branch. Resolved at ingest from the Scope the item arrived in, pinned on the Work Item, and independent of the Team that claims it — a Team never names one. A coordinate, not a connection: it carries a forge id, never a URL and never a credential (R8).

**Also known as:** target  
**Do not use:** team repo, repo_url  
**See also:** [Work Item](#work-item), [Forge](#forge), [Routing Rule](#routing-rule), [Team](#team)  

## Terms owned by other models

This model uses these terms with their owners' meaning: [Crew](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#crew), [Model](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#model), [Ready](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#ready), [Result](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#result), [Review](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#review), [Session](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#session), [Step](../../../../docs/reference/glossary.md#step).

## Decisions cited

- [Glide ADR-0002](../../../../docs/adr/adr-0002-ploeg-is-the-only-engine.md): Ploeg is the only execution engine and Vloer is its front end.

---

## Example dialogues

Short exchanges showing the terms used precisely at concept boundaries.

### Working on a ticket in De Vloer

> **Developer:** Where do I start working?
> **Product owner:** In De Vloer. A ticket can supply the objective. Start requests Ploeg admission; without Ploeg, De Vloer runs only its deterministic demo.
> **Developer:** Does that require OpenCode?
> **Product owner:** No. The tool running the agent is replaceable. De Vloer is the place you use.

### Research can recommend stopping

> **Developer:** The research says this product should not be built. Must the agent still build a prototype?
> **Product owner:** No. Convincing evidence, a business case and a clear conclusion to stop can finish that ticket.
> **Developer:** And if the evidence supports building it?
> **Product owner:** I expect a usable design document, recorded decisions, graphs, documentation, a business case and a final conclusion. A proof of concept may also help.

### Lease vs claim, and what a crash does
*Context: Dispatch*

> **Dev:** The implementer pod got OOM-killed halfway. Who cleans up its claim?
> **Domain expert:** The controller detects the expired **Lease** and applies the recovery policy (**R2**). Recovery does not depend on the dead pod running cleanup.
> **Dev:** So the item is lost?
> **Domain expert:** The retained record remains queryable. Unattended tracker work may retry within **R5**; operator-owned work keeps its stop intent. A stored **Checkpoint** does not guarantee automatic restoration of the harness session.
> **Dev:** And "claim" — is that a table?
> **Domain expert:** A verb. A **Team** claims an item, which means it acquires a **Lease**. If you're writing SQL, the noun is always Lease.

### stuck vs failed vs needs_human
*Context: Dispatch*

> **Dev:** The agent container exited zero but never wrote anything. Is that stuck?
> **Domain expert:** A missing **Outcome Report** needs expiry or reconciliation (**R3**). Legacy tracker work may requeue, but operator-owned work must preserve stop intent and uncertain effects.
> **Dev:** Then what's stuck?
> **Domain expert:** stuck is the agent saying "I understand the task and I cannot proceed" — it must give a reason (**R4**), and the **Work Item** goes to needs_human, not back to the queue.
> **Dev:** And stale?
> **Domain expert:** stale means the machinery gave up — repeated **Lease** expiries with no Outcome at all. needs_human is the agent asking for help; stale is Ploeg refusing to retry blindly.

---

## ⚠ Flagged ambiguities

### who decides that delegated work is finished

Successful checks, another agent's review and a person's approval are different possible conditions for finishing work; the product has no agreed rule for choosing between them.

**Options:** Choose the condition for each task, Always require a person's approval, Let the agent finish when its checks pass  
**Recommendation:** Choose the condition for each task so research, coding and other work can use appropriate checks and approval.  

### the "leased" Work Item state

The Work Item state enum calls the working state `leased`, named for the Lease it used to imply. After ADR-0010 a Work Item in that state has a Shift, and may have no Lease at all — a Round of readers takes none. The state name now describes the wrong thing.

**Options:** Keep `leased` and accept the vocabulary drift, Rename to `active`, Rename to `in_shift`  
**Recommendation:** Decide with the implementing change, not before. The rename touches the state enum, an applied migration, both contract schemas and the KEDA scaler query, so it is a real cost to weigh against a name that is merely imprecise. `active` reads best if it goes ahead.  

### when a Shift closes

ADR-0010 introduces the Shift but leaves its terminal rule to the implementation. A Shift plainly closes on a terminal Outcome; less plainly when an item goes needs_human and a human re-queues it — does the old Shift resume with its remaining budget and Round counter, or does a fresh one open?

**Options:** Re-queue always opens a new Shift (budget resets, rounds restart), Re-queue resumes the existing Shift (budget and rounds carry over), Human chooses per re-queue  
**Recommendation:** Resume the existing Shift. A re-queue after needs_human is usually a human unblocking work already done, and restarting the budget silently doubles what the item may cost. Confirm against the first real needs_human Shift.  

### follow-up mirroring

Follow-Ups enter at queued with no Tracker Item, which tensions with "the tracker is the source of truth for what to do" — work now exists that the board cannot see.

**Options:** Keep Follow-Ups tracker-invisible (current), Asynchronously write a Tracker Item back for every Follow-Up, Write back only Follow-Ups that survive longer than one Run  
**Recommendation:** Revisit in roadmap phase 2 (PR-feedback ingestion); async write-back is the likely answer so the board regains full visibility without blocking dispatch.  

### groomer run

The design says Ploeg "can schedule a groomer run" but grooming semantics belong to the operator — it is unclear whether Groomer is Ploeg vocabulary at all, and what distinguishes a groomer run from a normal Run.

**Options:** Keep Groomer out of the core language (operator concern), Define it as a Team with a single grooming Role, First-class GroomerRun concept  
**Recommendation:** Keep it out of the core language for now; if it lands in phase 2, model it as an ordinary Team whose single Role grooms — no new concepts.
