# Published contracts

The versioned, machine-readable seams of Ploeg (backlog #59). Go types in
`pkg/harness` are pinned to these schemas by `pkg/harness/contract_test.go`;
change either side and the test tells you.

| File | Contract |
|---|---|
| [taskspec.v1.schema.json](taskspec.v1.schema.json) | Harness input: what a run knows (work item, repo, branch, trace id, and the brief of the OpenSpec change the Work Item names). Credentials never travel here (R8). |
| [outcomereport.v1.schema.json](outcomereport.v1.schema.json) | Harness output and the body of `POST /api/v1/runs/{token}/outcome`. Stuck requires a reason (R4). The optional `createdWorkItems` carries the Work Items a Run proposes ([ADR-0031](../adrs/0031-runs-create-work-items-held-for-approval-within-limits.md)). |
| [checkpoint.v1.schema.json](checkpoint.v1.schema.json) | The durable progress record (shared by TaskSpec, OutcomeReport, and the checkpoint endpoint). |
| [run-api.v1.schema.json](run-api.v1.schema.json) | All run-API message bodies (claim/renew/checkpoint/outcome). |
| [operator-api.v1.schema.json](operator-api.v1.schema.json) | Authenticated, team-scoped read projections of teams, activity summaries, work items, shifts, runs, the Run list, checkpoints and snapshot audit pages, and the Run card of a Work Item ([ADR-0046](../adrs/0046-a-run-card-is-assembled-per-work-item-from-stored-facts.md)). |
| [deploy-api.v1.schema.json](deploy-api.v1.schema.json) | `POST /api/v1/deploys`: a pipeline reports that a commit is live in an environment, with its own bearer token ([ADR-0047](../adrs/0047-ploeg-learns-where-a-merged-change-is-deployed-from-a-generic-deploy-endpoint.md), [how-to](../how-to/send-deploys-from-a-pipeline.md)). |
| [tracker-execution.md](tracker-execution.md), [v1 schema](tracker-execution.v1.schema.json) | Scoped source lookup and exclusive operator binding of an existing pristine tracker Work Item. |
| [acp-profiles.md](acp-profiles.md) | The `acp` harness profiles: launch command, gateway wiring, instruction files and approval mapping per agent, and what an image needs to run them. |
| [executor.md](executor.md) | The executor SPI: what any launcher (KEDA, CronJob, agent-sandbox, a human with curl) must and must not do. |

## Versioning policy

- **v1 is frozen.** Additive *optional* fields are allowed (with a schema
  update in the same commit); renames, removals, type changes, or new
  required fields are v2 — a new schema file and explicit adapter
  negotiation, not an edit.
- Consumers must ignore unknown fields (Go's default decoding already does).
- The outcome enum is owned by `pkg/work/types.go`; the schema mirrors it.
  `usage` carries tokens, cost and sessionId (backlog #66/#70), and since
  [ADR-0045](../adrs/0045-keep-run-usage-and-merge-facts.md) the optional
  cache, turn, duration, tool-call, context and per-model figures. A harness
  leaves out any figure it did not measure; it never sends a default zero.
- The Run card (`GET /api/v1/operator/work-items/{id}/card`) is a new
  response, not a change to an existing one. Its `schemaVersion` is the
  number `1`, as the Vloer card contract states, where the older operator
  responses send the string `"1.0"`. It follows the same rule: a fact nobody
  reported is absent, never zero.
- Since [ADR-0047](../adrs/0047-ploeg-learns-where-a-merged-change-is-deployed-from-a-generic-deploy-endpoint.md)
  the card always carries `deployments` (earliest first deploy per
  environment) and `release` (an object or null), and each play carries its
  own `deployments`. They are required because Ploeg always sends them, empty
  or null when no deploy was reported. `release.source` is `merge` while the
  repository has never reported a deploy of its release environment.
- `deploy-api.v1` is the body of a pipeline's deploy report. It refuses
  unknown fields, unlike the response contracts, so a misspelled field fails
  the pipeline step instead of being dropped.

## OpenSpec Work Items

A Work Item names an OpenSpec change with a line `openspec: <change-id>` in its
description. The key is case-insensitive, the id may be in backticks, and
tracker HTML is ignored, so the line works from Vikunja, ClickUp, GitLab and
operator admission alike. The id must be kebab-case. A malformed line, two
different ids, or a change the worker cannot find in the clone stops the Run
as `stuck` before the harness starts.

The worker looks for `openspec/changes/<change-id>` at the repository root and
in nested directories (Glide keeps Ploeg's at `apps/ploeg/openspec`), without
following symbolic links. It fills the Task Spec's `openSpec` field with a
brief: from `openspec instructions apply --change <id> --json` when an
`openspec` executable is on the worker's PATH, otherwise from the change's
`proposal.md`, `design.md` and `tasks.md`. The prompt ranks the brief below the
delivery contract.

After a writing Run opens or updates a pull request, and after a reading Run
on the branch under review, the worker checks out the pushed branch and runs
`openspec validate <id> --type change --strict --json --no-interactive`
itself:

| Run | Gate passes | Gate fails | Gate cannot run |
|---|---|---|---|
| Writing | Outcome kept; the summary says it passed | `stuck` with the validation output and the pull request link | `stuck` with the reason |
| Reading | Verdict kept | Verdict `request_changes`; the output is put ahead of the findings | `stuck` with the reason |

The CLI runs with `OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0`, `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, a scratch `HOME`
and no forge token or model key. The worker never downloads it. A harness
image without the CLI can still brief a Run from the files, but every gated
Run then ends at `needs_human`. Baking `@fission-ai/openspec` into the runner
images is proposed, not done.

## Operator read consumers

`PLOEG_OPERATOR_CONSUMERS` is a JSON array of named consumer policies. Each
entry requires `name` and `tokenEnv`; the bearer value is resolved from that
environment reference and retained as a hash. Tokens require at least 32 bytes.
An omitted `teams` grants all teams, an empty array grants none, and a populated
array restricts every resource read. `execute` defaults to false. Consumers
with execution permission may set `maxBudgetUsd` from 0.01 to 10000; the default
is 25. A read credential does not authorize execution commands.

`verify` defaults to false and grants the separate trusted delivery-verifier
operations. Configure that permission on a distinct consumer identity. The
chart forwards `operator.deliveryPolicies` as an array through
`PLOEG_OPERATOR_DELIVERY_POLICIES`; each entry pins `repositoryId`,
`policySha256`, `verifierId`, `minTests` and optional `publicationEnabled`.
Publication remains disabled when that last field is omitted. Policies and
verifier credentials stay in the controller deployment.

The token is supplied as `Authorization: Bearer …`. No consumers configured
means every operator request is refused. Consumer names and policies may live
in configuration; bearer values belong in the deployment's existing secret
provisioning path, supplied through environment references.

Read routes are `GET /api/v1/operator/teams`, `/summary`, `/work-items`,
`/work-items/{id}`, `/runs`, `/runs/{id}` and `/events`. Item/event pages accept `after`
and `limit` (default 50, maximum 200); IDs and cursors are decimal strings.
Item filters are `team`, `state`, `needsHuman=true` and the tracker identity
`provider` plus `externalId`; event filters are `team` and `workItemId`.
`provider` and `externalId` must be given together, otherwise the request
returns 400. Without `team` they match across every team in the consumer's
scope, so a client can ask whether Ploeg holds a given Tracker Item. Detail
embeds the latest 200 records per collection and marks truncated histories.
Unknown costs remain unknown, and `paused` is null because the current team
model has no pause state.

Each team lists its `assignees`: the tracker usernames, lowercased and sorted,
whose assignment routes a Tracker Item to that team. They come from
`teams.<team>.assignees` in the configuration file and from `PLOEG_TEAM_MAP`.
A team no username routes to has an empty list.
Each team also lists its `pinnedScopes`: tracker container ids (a Vikunja
project or ClickUp list, pinned by id with `team:` in the configuration file)
whose items run as that team whoever is assigned. A client that assigns tracker
users uses it to know which team will actually receive the work.

Events default to ascending order. `order=desc` returns the newest events
first and pages older with `before=<id>`; its `nextCursor` is the next `before`
value and `lastCursor` is the newest id in the page, so a client can follow new
events with `after`. Combining `after` with `order=desc`, or `before` without
it, returns 400.

`/summary?window=24h|7d|30d` (default `7d`) reports, per team in scope and in
total, current Work Item counts by state, current pending and running Runs and
reserved budget, and the Runs finished and spend settled inside the window.
Settled spend is the sum of gateway reconciliation deltas plus the reported
cost of Runs without a gateway account. `lastActivityAt` is the team's latest
bound audit event. Teams appear when they have a Work Item or are registered.

`/runs` lists Runs newest first by id. It filters on `team`, `state` and
`outcome`, takes `limit` (1 to 200, default 50) and pages with
`before=<runId>`, returning `nextBefore`. `externalRef` is the tracker
reference agents put in commit trailers, empty for manual Operator Executions.
`settledUsd` is the reconciled gateway spend, or the reported cost of a
finished Run without a gateway account, and null otherwise. Summary and Run
list timestamps are UTC.

Audit pages explicitly say `consistency: snapshot`: sequence allocation is
not transaction commit order, so clients must not treat this as a lossless
changefeed. Unbound forge events are excluded. Read projections omit worker
and gateway credentials and native harness session IDs; audit details are
allowlisted, recognizable credential patterns are redacted, and URLs omit
queries/fragments. Team authorization follows the work item's current team.
Each request has a bounded execution time and response size.

The Helm chart's `operator.consumers` entries resolve `tokenSecret: {name, key}`
into controller-only `secretKeyRef` environment variables. The generated
consumer policy references those variables. No value is embedded in Helm
configuration or inherited by a worker. See the [render fixture](../../ops/helm/ploeg/ci/operator-values.yaml)
and the [controller-isolation assertion](../../pkg/config/operator_chart_test.go).

`POST /api/v1/operator/work-items/{id}/cancel` withdraws tracker-originated
work, with the same effect as unassigning its Tracker Item. It needs `execute`
permission, `X-Ploeg-Actor` and team scope, and it takes no body. The live
Shift closes with reason `withdrawn_by_operator`, pending Runs are cancelled,
running Runs are finished and their model keys blocked, and the Work Item
becomes `withdrawn`. A repeated call returns `withdrawn: false`. An item bound
to an Operator Execution returns 409; cancel the execution instead.

Execution requests additionally require `X-Ploeg-Actor`, the stable session
owner identity asserted by the authenticated consumer. Commands may carry
`X-Ploeg-Acting-User` when an authorized administrator acts for that owner.
Ploeg validates a single bounded identity, binds it to command replay and
records it as the event actor; the execution owner remains unchanged. The
header defaults to the owner, including delegated internal executor reports.
The server overrides any `authenticatedBy` supplied in a command body.
Consumers must derive both identities from authenticated session authorization,
never forward an untrusted browser header.

Managed workers use the [worker control contract](worker-control.md); deployment and conservative accounting recovery are documented in [managed worker operations](../ops/managed-workers.md).

The [operator delivery contract](operator-delivery.md) and [versioned schema](operator-delivery.schema.json) govern canonical candidates, trusted verification, human approval and durable publication barriers for a completed Operator Execution.
