# Route a board that serves several repositories

**Goal:** one tracker board holds tickets for more than one repository. A ticket labelled `repo/<target>` goes to that repository, and a ticket without such a label goes to the board's default, as it does today.

**How it works:** you register repositories under `targets:` in ploegd's configuration file, and each board names the targets it may use. A label is only a choice among those registered targets; it can never name a repository of its own ([ADR-0038](../adrs/0038-a-repo-label-selects-among-registered-targets-and-the-board-default-is-the-fallback.md)). Ploeg reads the labels once, when the ticket is assigned, and pins the result on the Work Item.

Read [Before you start](index.md#before-you-start) for names and the database session.

## 1. Register the targets

Add a `targets:` map to the chart's `config:` value, next to `trackers:`. The key is the text after `repo/` in the label, so the label `repo/homelab-cluster` selects the key `homelab-cluster`.

```yaml
config:
  targets:
    glide:
      repo: webgrip/glide
      branch: development
      forge: forgejo
    homelab-cluster:
      repo: webgrip/homelab-cluster
      branch: main
      forge: forgejo
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `repo` | `owner/name`, required |
| `branch` | Base branch. Unset means the repository's default branch, which may be a stale stub, so set it |
| `forge` | Forge instance id. Unset means `PLOEG_TARGET_FORGE`, default `forgejo` |

Two keys may point at one repository, for example an old and a new label name for the same product.

## 2. Point the board at the targets

Give the board a `default:` (a target key) instead of `repo`, `branch` and `forge`, and list the other targets its labels may select under `allow:`:

```yaml
config:
  trackers:
    vikunja:
      projects:
        - name: "Glide"
          id: "10"
          default: glide
          allow: [homelab-cluster]
```

The three shapes a board can take:

| Board config | Ticket without a `repo/*` label | Ticket with `repo/<key>` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `default: <key>` plus `allow:` | goes to the default | goes to `<key>` if it is the default or in `allow` |
| `repo:` (the existing shape), optionally with `allow:` | goes to `repo` | goes to `<key>` if its target is the board's own repository or in `allow` |
| only `allow:` (hint-required) | refused | goes to `<key>` if it is in `allow` |

A board without `allow:` may only select its own default. ploegd refuses to start when a `default` or `allow` entry names a key that is not under `targets:`, when a board sets both `default` and `repo`, or when a board has none of `repo`, `default` and `allow`.

## 3. Label the tickets

Give a ticket that belongs to another repository exactly one `repo/<key>` label. Ploeg compares the whole label title with `repo/` plus each key, character for character. `repo/Homelab-Cluster` does not match `homelab-cluster`, and is refused as an unregistered label. Labels without the `repo/` prefix are ignored.

Ploeg refuses the ticket, queues nothing and comments on it with the reason when:

- it carries two different `repo/*` labels (two labels with the same title count as one),
- a `repo/*` label names no registered key,
- the label names a registered key the board does not allow,
- the board has no default and the ticket has no `repo/*` label,
- the board selects by label and Ploeg could not read the ticket from Vikunja, so the labels are unknown,
- the selected target is not ready (step 4).

None of these falls back to the default or to a worker's own repository. To retry, fix the label and assign the ticket again. Changing a label on a ticket that is already queued changes nothing: the target was pinned when it was assigned.

**Once `targets:` exists, the label rules apply to every board in the file.** A ticket on any routed board that carries a `repo/*` label no target is registered for, such as a label for an archived repository, is refused from then on. Before you add `targets:`, list the `repo/*` labels in use and register or remove each one.

## 4. Check that each target is ready

When ploegd starts, it asks the forge about every registered target and logs `registered target ready` or `registered target not ready` with the reason. A target is not ready when its repository is archived, is a mirror, or has no `AGENTS.md` at the root of its base branch ([prepare a repository](../../../../docs/how-to/prepare-a-repository.md)).

- **At assignment:** a ticket that resolves to a target not ready is refused with that reason. Ploeg asks the forge again first, so a repository you fixed after startup is accepted without a restart.
- **At claim:** Ploeg checks again before any Run starts. If the target became unready, the Run ends `stuck` with the reason and the Work Item moves to `needs_human`. If the forge cannot be reached, the Run ends as a retryable infrastructure failure and the Work Item goes back in the queue.

Only the Forgejo forge can report readiness. A target on another forge is never ready.

## 5. Verify

1. Restart ploegd after the change (the config checksum on the Deployment does this) and read its log: `target map loaded` reports `registered_targets`, followed by one readiness line per target.
2. Assign a labelled ticket and look for `target resolved` with `hint=repo/<key>` and `registered_target=<key>`.
3. Check the pinned route on the Work Item:

   ```sql
   SELECT external_id, route_rule, route_hint, target_owner, target_repo, target_base_branch
   FROM work_items WHERE provider = 'vikunja' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. List refusals, which have an audit row and no Work Item:

   ```sql
   SELECT at, detail->>'external_id' AS ticket, detail->>'reason' AS reason
   FROM audit_log WHERE action = 'work_item.route_refused' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20;
   ```

## Not implemented yet

- An item whose board matches no rule and that carries no `repo/*` label still falls back to the worker's own repository, as before. Strict routing, which would refuse it (backlog #108), is a separate change.
- The registry is kept by hand. Deriving it from the repository configuration in `webgrip/homelab-cluster` is ADR-0038's later step G1.

## Symptoms

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ploegd does not start: `target "x" is not in targets` | A board names a key that is not registered | Add the key under `targets:` or remove it from the board |
| Ticket comment: `names no registered target` | The label has no matching key, or differs in case or spacing | Register the key, or fix the label title |
| Ticket comment: `does not allow` | The key is registered but not in this board's `allow` | Add it to `allow`, or move the ticket to the right board |
| Ticket comment: `requires a repository label` | Hint-required board and no `repo/*` label | Add one label and assign again |
| Ticket comment: `labels could not be read` | ploegd has no Vikunja API credentials, or the read failed | Set `PLOEG_VIKUNJA_URL` and `PLOEG_VIKUNJA_TOKEN`, then assign again |
| Ticket comment: `is not ready` | Target archived, a mirror, or no `AGENTS.md` on its base branch | Fix the repository or the target's `branch`, then assign again |
| Work Item in `needs_human` with a run `stuck` on `is not ready` | The target became unready after the ticket was queued | Fix the repository, then assign the ticket again |
