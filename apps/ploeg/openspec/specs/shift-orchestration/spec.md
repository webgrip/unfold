# shift-orchestration Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change run-multi-agent-shifts. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: A queued Work Item gets exactly one live Shift

When a Work Item enters `queued`, ploegd SHALL open a Shift for the Team that
owns it, carrying the branch, the budget pool and round zero. Two Teams SHALL
never hold a live Shift on the same Work Item (R1 in its Shift form).

#### Scenario: First assignment opens a Shift

- **WHEN** an assignment webhook queues a Work Item for team `bronze`
- **THEN** a Shift exists for that item with `round = 0` and `closed_at` null
- **AND** its branch is derived from the item, not from Team config

#### Scenario: A second Team cannot open a competing Shift

- **GIVEN** a live Shift on Work Item 42
- **WHEN** another Team attempts to open one on the same item
- **THEN** the attempt fails at the database, not in application code

#### Scenario: A plan-less Team behaves exactly as today

- **GIVEN** a Team with no configured plan
- **WHEN** its Work Item is queued
- **THEN** one Round with one writing Role is opened
- **AND** the observable behaviour is identical to the pre-Shift dispatch path

### Requirement: Rounds advance only when every Run in them has finished

ploegd SHALL open the next Round only when the current Round has no Run in
`pending` or `running`. Advancement SHALL be derived from Run state, never
reported by an agent (R2 — the pipeline must not depend on an agent behaving
well).

#### Scenario: A Round with one live reader does not advance

- **GIVEN** a Round of three readers, two finished and one still running
- **WHEN** the orchestrator evaluates the Shift
- **THEN** no new Round is opened

#### Scenario: A completed reader Round advances to the writer Round

- **GIVEN** a Round of three readers that have all reported
- **WHEN** the orchestrator evaluates the Shift
- **THEN** the next Round in the plan opens with one writing Role
- **AND** the writer's Run receives the readers' findings

#### Scenario: A swept READING Run does not block its Round forever

- **GIVEN** a reading Run whose pod died without reporting
- **WHEN** `ExpireRuns` reclaims it
- **THEN** the Round can complete and the Shift advances
- **AND** the Round's remaining findings still reach the next Round

### Requirement: A failed writing Run re-opens its Round rather than advancing the plan

A Round whose WRITING Run ended `failed` SHALL NOT advance the plan. The
orchestrator SHALL re-open that Round in place — without incrementing the round
counter, which doubles as the index into the Team's plan — until the Role
exhausts an attempt budget, after which the Shift SHALL close at `needs_human`
naming the repeated failure.

The budget SHALL be split by who failed (ADR-0021). An attempt whose
`failure_reason` is an infrastructure reason — the pod was killed, the node
went away, the gateway did not answer — SHALL count against
`MaxInfraFailures`; every other attempt SHALL count against `MaxRunAttempts`.
The two SHALL close the Shift with different reasons, because the reason is
what tells a person whether to look at the ticket or at the cluster. An
unrecognised `failure_reason` SHALL count against `MaxRunAttempts`, so a reason
nobody set cannot buy unlimited infrastructure retries.

`failed` is retryable by construction — it is the sweeper's verdict on a pod
that stopped renewing, or the worker's own report that its pod was taken away —
which is what distinguishes it from a `stuck` Outcome, where a human is needed
and no retry fixes it (R4). The attempt counts SHALL be derived from the Runs
in the Round, not held in a counter.

A reading Run's failure costs an opinion; a writing Run's failure costs the
work. Advancing over the latter means every later Round reasons about a branch
that was never written.

#### Scenario: The writer's pod dies

- **GIVEN** a Round whose only writing Run was reclaimed by `ExpireRuns`
- **WHEN** the orchestrator evaluates the Shift
- **THEN** the same Round re-opens with that writing Role
- **AND** the round counter does not advance
- **AND** no later Round of the plan is opened

#### Scenario: The writer keeps dying

- **GIVEN** a writing Role that has failed `MaxRunAttempts` times in one Round
  for reasons the agent is answerable for
- **WHEN** the orchestrator evaluates the Shift
- **THEN** the Shift closes at `needs_human`
- **AND** the close reason names the repeated failure rather than plan exhaustion

#### Scenario: The writer's pod keeps being killed

- **GIVEN** a writing Role whose Runs in one Round all ended `failed` for
  infrastructure reasons
- **WHEN** the orchestrator evaluates the Shift, fewer than `MaxInfraFailures`
  times
- **THEN** the Round re-opens with that writing Role
- **AND** the Role's `MaxRunAttempts` budget is undiminished, because nothing
  about the work has been tried

#### Scenario: The cluster keeps killing the writer

- **GIVEN** a writing Role whose Runs have failed `MaxInfraFailures` times in
  one Round for infrastructure reasons
- **WHEN** the orchestrator evaluates the Shift
- **THEN** the Shift closes at `needs_human`
- **AND** the close reason names the infrastructure failure, distinctly from
  the reason used when the agent itself kept failing

### Requirement: A Shift closes on plan exhaustion or a terminal Outcome

A Shift SHALL close when its Team's plan has no further Round, or when any Run
reports an Outcome that ends the work. A closed Shift SHALL record why, so
"why did this item stop" is a query rather than a reconstruction, and SHALL
release the item's live-Shift slot so a later re-mandate can open a fresh one.

#### Scenario: The plan runs out

- **WHEN** the last Round of a Team's plan completes
- **THEN** the Shift closes with a recorded reason
- **AND** the Work Item reaches `needs_human` so a person is asked to merge

#### Scenario: A stuck Outcome freezes the plan

- **GIVEN** any Run reports `stuck` with a reason (R4)
- **THEN** the Shift closes, no further Round opens, and the item goes
  `needs_human` carrying that reason

### Requirement: An exhausted budget pool parks the item rather than failing it

When `ClaimRole` raises `ErrBudgetExhausted`, ploegd SHALL move the Work Item
to `needs_human` with an R4 reason naming the spend. Retrying cannot fix
running out of money.

#### Scenario: The pool empties mid-Shift

- **GIVEN** a Shift whose remaining budget is below the viable floor
- **WHEN** the next Round would open
- **THEN** no Run is spawned, no attempt is burned, no credential is minted
- **AND** the item is `needs_human` with a reason naming the pool and the spend
