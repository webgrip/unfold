# glide-repository Specification

## Purpose
How Ploeg and Vloer live in one Glide repository: both source histories and
application identities are preserved, root commands and CI validate both
applications and their shared contract, and shared documentation sits at the
root while contracts and decisions stay with their application. Archived from
the change `2026-09-23-assemble-glide-monorepo`.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Preserve source histories and reviewed content

Glide SHALL retain both source histories, the audited working-tree changes, and separate application directories. Imported tags MUST have collision-free application namespaces.

#### Scenario: Verify an imported application

- **WHEN** the migration completes
- **THEN** each recorded source HEAD is an ancestor of Glide and the import manifest accounts for every input path

### Requirement: Preserve independent application operation

Applications SHALL retain their existing package, image, chart and module identities. Root commands and CI SHALL validate both applications from their new paths, including the cross-application contract.

#### Scenario: Validate the new checkout

- **WHEN** the root verification command runs
- **THEN** application tests, document checks and cross-application qualification execute with explicit results

### Requirement: Maintain one shared documentation source

Shared product language and workflows SHALL live in root documentation. Service contracts and decision records SHALL remain owned by their applications.

#### Scenario: Follow a moved guide

- **WHEN** a reader uses an old local documentation path
- **THEN** the guide remains available through a redirect or points to its canonical destination
