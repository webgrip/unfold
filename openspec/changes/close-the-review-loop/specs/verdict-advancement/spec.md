# Verdict-driven advancement

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A reading Run may return a verdict

A reading Run MAY return `verdict` in its `OutcomeReport`, one of `approve` or
`request_changes`. Ploeg SHALL persist it with the Run and SHALL ignore a
verdict returned by a writing Role (ADR-0017).

#### Scenario: A reviewer asks for changes

- **WHEN** a reading Run reports `request_changes` with findings
- **THEN** the verdict and the findings are both recorded against that Run

#### Scenario: A writer cannot grade its own work

- **WHEN** a writing Run reports `request_changes`
- **THEN** the verdict is ignored and the plan advances as if none was given

#### Scenario: No verdict is not a request for changes

- **WHEN** a reading Run reports findings without a verdict
- **THEN** the Shift closes at plan exhaustion as it does today

### Requirement: A request for changes re-opens the plan's writer, bounded

When a plan's final Round completes and any reading Run in it reported
`request_changes`, ploegd SHALL re-open the plan's last writing Round with the
findings injected, followed by the review Round. Each such pair is one fix
round. The loop SHALL be bounded, checked in this order: the Shift pool first,
then `maxFixRounds`, then the verdict.

#### Scenario: A fix round opens and the writer sees why

- **GIVEN** a plan whose final Round is a reviewer that reported `request_changes`
- **WHEN** the orchestrator evaluates the Shift
- **THEN** the plan's writing Round re-opens
- **AND** the writer's briefing carries that reviewer's findings

#### Scenario: An approval ends the Shift

- **GIVEN** a reviewer that reported `approve`
- **THEN** no further Round opens and the Shift closes, with the item reaching
  needs_human so a person is asked to merge

#### Scenario: The cap stops a reviewer that never approves

- **GIVEN** a reviewer that reports `request_changes` every time
- **WHEN** `maxFixRounds` fix rounds have run
- **THEN** the Shift closes with a reason naming the cap

#### Scenario: Money stops the loop before the cap does

- **GIVEN** a Shift whose remaining pool cannot fund another Round
- **WHEN** a fix round would otherwise open
- **THEN** no Run is spawned, no attempt is burned, no credential is minted
- **AND** the item is needs_human with a reason naming the spend

### Requirement: The fix-round count is derived, never counted

The number of fix rounds run SHALL be derived from the Shift's round counter
against its plan's length, not stored in a column. A counter can disagree with
what actually happened; a derivation cannot.

#### Scenario: The count survives a restart mid-loop

- **GIVEN** a Shift two fix rounds in
- **WHEN** ploegd restarts and the sweeper evaluates it
- **THEN** the same number of fix rounds is derived and the cap still applies

### Requirement: A plan that cannot fix anything is refused at boot

A Team plan configuring `maxFixRounds` greater than zero with no writing Round
SHALL be rejected when the configuration is parsed, not when a Shift reaches
its final Round.

#### Scenario: A reader-only plan with fix rounds fails fast

- **WHEN** ploegd starts with a plan of readers only and `maxFixRounds: 2`
- **THEN** it refuses to start, naming the team
