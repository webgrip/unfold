// The drop box: how an agent returns a structured OutcomeReport (ADR-0018).
//
// worker.ComposePrompt tells every reading Run to deliver its review by
// writing JSON to the file named by PLOEG_OUTCOME_FILE. That instruction is
// harness-independent, so honouring it must be too: an adapter that does not
// set the variable and read the file back swallows the review, and — because
// shiftengine.requestsChanges reads agent_runs.verdict — silently makes
// ADR-0017's review loop inert rather than failing visibly.
//
// Writers normally leave the drop box absent, which is why "no file" means
// "no structured signal" and never an error: the forge poll stays the sole
// ground truth for whether a pull request exists (R2).

// DropBoxEnv names the drop box to the agent. The prompt refers to this
// variable by name, so the two must not drift.

// DropBoxPath is where an adapter should put the drop box for one run.
//
// RunEnv.ScratchDir is os.TempDir() and shared per process, so the name
// carries the trace id — two runs in one container must not collide, and a
// run that dies before writing must not inherit its predecessor's report.

// MergeDropBox layers what an agent reported onto what the adapter concluded.
//
// The split is deliberate and is the whole of the precedence rule:
//
//   - Findings and Verdict are the agent's to report and ALWAYS survive. A
//     run that produced a review and then failed its shutdown handshake still
//     did the review, and dropping it loses work that was actually done.
//   - Outcome and Summary fill in only where the adapter concluded nothing.
//     An adapter that classified a launch failure, a lost lease or a watchdog
//     timeout has structured evidence the agent does not, and an agent must
//     never be able to overwrite that by writing a cheerful file.
//   - Usage prefers the agent's own accounting when the adapter has none.
//
// StuckReason rides with Outcome, so R4 (a stuck outcome always carries a
// reason) holds however the two halves combine.
