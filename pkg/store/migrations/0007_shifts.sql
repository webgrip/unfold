-- Shifts: several personas work one Work Item, some of them at once.
-- ADR-0010 (Shift owns the item, Lease owns the branch), ADR-0012 (two-level
-- budgets), ADR-0013 (push rights minted per Run).
--
-- A Shift is one Team's engagement with one Work Item. It owns the branch, the
-- budget pool and the round counter. A Round is a set of Runs that start
-- together: either a fan-out of readers or a single writer, never both.
--
-- The load-bearing choice here is that a Round MATERIALISES its Runs. When a
-- Round opens, one agent_runs row per Role is inserted as 'pending'. Claiming
-- flips a pending row to 'running'. That buys three things at once:
--
--   * the roster is explicit and queryable rather than reconstructed;
--   * the KEDA scaler query and the claim predicate become the SAME query
--     ("pending runs for this team and role"), so they cannot drift — the
--     failure mode where undershoot stalls items silently and forever;
--   * reserved budget is a SUM over running rows, so it cannot disagree with
--     reality the way a hand-maintained counter can.
