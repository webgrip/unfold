// A failed writing Run re-opens its own Round, capped (ADR-0019).
//
// The asymmetry between readers and writers is the whole of it. A Round that
// loses a READER loses an opinion, and the shift-orchestration spec is right
// that this must not stall the item. A Round that loses its WRITER loses the
// work: the branch was never written, and every later Round is then reasoning
// about something that does not exist. Left alone, the reviewer reviews
// nothing, returns `approve`, and the Shift closes `review_approved` with no
// pull request — the most reassuring close reason there is, for a Shift that
// produced nothing.
//
// `failed` is not the agent's word. It is the sweeper's verdict on a pod that
// stopped renewing (ExpireRuns), which is precisely what makes it retryable
// and precisely what distinguishes it from `stuck` (R4: a stuck Outcome says a
// human is needed, and no retry fixes that).
