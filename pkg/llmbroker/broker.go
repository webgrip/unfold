// Package llmbroker is the credential seam between Ploeg and an LLM
// gateway: mint a budgeted per-run credential before the harness starts,
// revoke it on every return path, and reconcile leaks from ploegd's sweeps.
// Callers speak run tokens; gateway-specific identity (LiteLLM's hashed
// tokens, the alias format) stays inside the implementation.

// shifts.spent stayed 0.0000 — silently, because the settlement SQL
// COALESCEs a missing cost to zero.
